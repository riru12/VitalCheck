# **VitalCheck**
developed for CS 180 (Artificial Intelligence) class, VitalCheck is an AI project that uses the power of support vector machines (SVM) to predict the occurrence of heart attacks. This project uses the **ReactJS** library to develop the front-end and **scikit-learn** and **Flask** framework (and other packages) for the back-end.

This project was developed by:
* Chase Gonzaga
* Althea Manansala
* Jeff Pecson
* Brill Ri√±a

## **Installation**
Once you have set up a virtual environment (optional, but preferably), use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the needed Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the Flask server, use the command:
```bash
python backend/server.py
```

To install the JavaScript packages and run the website, do the following:
```bash
cd vitalcheck
npm install
npm start
```
